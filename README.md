# Data Analysis and Classification Project

## üìú Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset to extract actionable insights, uncover patterns, and develop a classification model to prioritize cases effectively. It is aimed at solving business problems using text analysis and machine learning techniques.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Objectives
1. **Actionable Insights**:
   - Extract insights from textual data to inform business decisions.
   - Identify recurring issues or themes within the dataset.

2. **Clustering**:
   - Group similar data points using unsupervised learning to uncover patterns and relationships.

3. **Classification** *(Good to Have)*:
   - Build a machine learning model to classify and prioritize cases based on the analyzed data.

## üìä Dataset
The dataset includes information with text fields such as:
- `Subject`: Brief description of the issue.
- `Description`: Detailed description of the case.
- `Priority`: Target variable for classification.

**Preprocessing Steps**:
- Cleaned the text data (e.g., removed stopwords, punctuation).
- Combined and transformed text fields into numerical features using TF-IDF.

## üß∞ Tools & Libraries
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Manipulation**: `pandas`, `numpy`
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: `nltk`, `sklearn`
- **Visualization**: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- **Machine Learning**: `sklearn`

## üöÄ Project Workflow

### 1. **Actionable Insights**
- Performed text preprocessing to clean and prepare the data.
- Used **TF-IDF** to identify the most frequent keywords and themes.
- Highlighted recurring issues to help prioritize business decisions.

### 2. **Clustering**
- Transformed text data into numerical features using TF-IDF.
- Applied **KMeans Clustering** to group similar cases.
- Visualized clusters using **PCA** for better interpretation.

### 3. **Classification**
- Built a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict the priority of cases.
- Evaluated the model using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

## üìà Results
- **Insights**: Identified frequent customer concerns to guide business priorities.
- **Clustering**: Grouped cases into distinct clusters, uncovering relationships between issues.
- **Classification**: Achieved a high F1-score, indicating effective classification of case priorities.
